## Left-to-Right Navigation Script (`left_to_right.py`)

### Overview

The `left_to_right.py` script is a foundational ROS2 node designed to enable basic navigation capabilities for a robot. Its primary function is to receive movement commands and translate them into actionable velocity commands, facilitating straightforward maneuvers such as moving forward, turning left or right, and stopping.

### Theory Behind the Code

At its core, the script leverages ROS2's publisher-subscriber architecture to facilitate communication between different parts of the robot's system:

- **Publishers:** Components that send out messages to specific topics.
- **Subscribers:** Components that listen to messages from specific topics.

By subscribing to command inputs and publishing corresponding velocity commands, the node ensures that the robot can respond dynamically to external instructions, enabling manual control over its movements.

### Code Structure and Components

1. **Imports:**
    - **ROS2 Libraries:** Essential for node creation, message handling, and communication.
    - **Standard Messages:** Utilizes `String`, `Bool`, `Twist`, and `LaserScan` messages for various functionalities.
    - **Random Module:** Potentially used for introducing variability in movement patterns.

2. **Class Definition (`RobotControlNode`):**

        - **Modes:**
            - Manages operational modes such as `'idol'`, `'roaming'`, and `'active'`.

3. **Callbacks:**
    - **Range Sensor Callbacks:** Process incoming LiDAR data to determine the minimum distance to obstacles.
    - **Command Callback:** Handles incoming movement and mode commands, directing the robot's behavior accordingly.
    - **Object Detection Callback:** Responds to object detection events by stopping the robot and initiating verbal communication.

4. **Movement Handling:**
    - **Manual Commands:** Processes commands like `'move forward'`, `'turn left'`, `'turn right'`, and `'stop'` to control movement.
    - **Roaming Behavior:** Implements autonomous movement patterns, responding to obstacles by deciding turning directions based on sensor inputs.

5. **Utility Methods:**
    - **`publish_text_to_speech`:** Facilitates verbal communication by publishing messages to be converted into speech.
    - **`stop_robot`:** Halts all movement by sending zero velocities.

6. **Node Execution:**
    - **`main` Function:** Initializes and spins the node, allowing it to operate and respond to incoming messages.

### Operational Flow

1. **Initialization:**
    - The node starts in `'idol'` mode, remaining stationary.
    - Publishers and subscribers are set up to handle communication.

2. **Receiving Commands:**
    - Upon receiving movement commands via `/robot_commands`, the node executes the corresponding actions, such as moving forward or turning.

3. **Obstacle Detection:**
    - Continuously monitors front-left and front-right LiDAR sensors.
    - If an obstacle is detected within the threshold distance (`0.5` meters), the node stops forward movement and decides on a turning direction based on which side has more space.

4. **Roaming Behavior:**
    - In `'roaming'` mode, the node autonomously moves forward.
    - Responds to obstacles by turning left or right for a specified duration to navigate around them.

5. **Object Detection Handling:**
    - If an object is detected (`/object_detected` publishes `True`), the node stops movement and publishes a message to `/text_to_speech` to communicate verbally.

## Theoretical Concepts

### ROS2 Nodes

**Definition:** In ROS2, a node is an executable that performs computation. Nodes communicate with each other using topics, services, and actions, forming a distributed system that enables complex robotic behaviors through modular and scalable architecture.

**Role in System:** Each node encapsulates specific functionalities, promoting separation of concerns and reusability. For example, one node may handle sensor data processing, while another manages navigation.

### Publishers and Subscribers

**Publishers:**
- **Function:** Send messages to a specified topic.
- **Use Case:** The `RobotControlNode` publishes velocity commands to the `/cmd_vel` topic to control the robot's movement.

**Subscribers:**
- **Function:** Receive messages from a specified topic.
- **Use Case:** The `RobotControlNode` subscribes to the `/map` topic to receive occupancy grid data from the SLAM node, enabling mapping and navigation.

### Quality of Service (QoS) Profiles

**Definition:** QoS settings in ROS2 determine the communication behavior between publishers and subscribers, handling aspects like reliability, durability, and message ordering.

**Components:**
- **Reliability:** Defines the guarantee of message delivery (`RELIABLE` vs. `BEST_EFFORT`).
- **History:** Specifies how messages are stored (`KEEP_LAST` vs. `KEEP_ALL`).
- **Depth:** Determines the queue size for storing messages.

**Implications:** Selecting appropriate QoS settings ensures that critical messages are delivered reliably, while less important data can tolerate occasional losses, optimizing communication efficiency.

### Timers and Callbacks

**Timers:**
- **Function:** Invoke callbacks at specified intervals, enabling periodic tasks.
- **Use Case:** The `roaming_timer` in the `RobotControlNode` periodically calls the `roaming_behavior` method to manage autonomous exploration.

**Callbacks:**
- **Function:** Execute predefined functions upon receiving messages or timer events.
- **Use Case:** `map_callback` processes occupancy grid maps when a new message arrives.

**Importance:** Timers and callbacks facilitate responsive and timely actions within the node, enabling real-time decision-making and control.
