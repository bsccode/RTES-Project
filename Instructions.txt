Follow the steps to run the project in gazebo and see results.

1. Use ROSBOT_SIM command to run simulation on Gazebo (if not working refer to LAB manual 2 and 3 to set enviornment)
{Use Add Entity to add a sphere in view of the robot camera change the sphere color to dark blue from sphere visual frop down and selecting material option from the top as shown in screenshot}
2. make new directory with name "ros2_ws" 
3. create new package with name "tutorial_pkg"
4. in the src folder of the pacakge create publisher and subscriber files in .cpp format
5. now copy the code provided in the Github for publisher subscriber and CMAKE list
6. build the project using colcon build command
7. source the directory with "source ~/rosbot_ws/install/setup.bash" command
8. Open 4 new terminals to run Gazebo, publisher, subscriber and teleopkey terminal seperately
9. Now firstly run the gazebo in terminal1
10.Than run publisher code using "ros2 run tutorial_pkg rotate_robot_publisher" terminal2
11.Than run the subscriber code using "ros2 run tutorial_pkg velocity_subscriber" terminal3
12.Than run the teleopkey command to control robot manually using "ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard" in terminal4
13.Add 3 spheres in gazebo Red, Green and Blue colored in different locations of the map


***********please donot forget to update the CMakelists file ************************

At this point the robot should be in your control via keyboard and the publisher will open a threshold mask window to detect different color of balls. Now the publisher will share the X and Y coordinates as well as the color of the ball using a shared variable to the subscriber and subscriber will print those values using that shared variable.
