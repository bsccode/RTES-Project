## Left-to-Right Navigation Script (`left_to_right.py`)

### Overview

The `left_to_right.py` script is a foundational ROS2 node designed to enable basic navigation capabilities for a robot. Its primary function is to receive movement commands and translate them into actionable velocity commands, facilitating straightforward maneuvers such as moving forward, turning left or right, and stopping.

### Theory Behind the Code

At its core, the script leverages ROS2's publisher-subscriber architecture to facilitate communication between different parts of the robot's system:

- **Publishers:** Components that send out messages to specific topics.
- **Subscribers:** Components that listen to messages from specific topics.

## Bug2 Navigator Node (`bug2_navigator_node.py`)

### Overview

The `bug2_navigator_node.py` script introduces the Bug2 algorithm into the Robot Control System, enhancing the robot's navigation capabilities with a reliable obstacle avoidance and goal-reaching strategy. The Bug2 algorithm is a simple yet effective method for robot navigation in environments with obstacles, ensuring that the robot can reach its goal by following the boundary of obstacles when direct paths are blocked.

### Theory Behind the Algorithm

**Bug2 Algorithm:** Bug2 is a path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithm used in robotics to navigate from a start position to a goal position in an environment with obstacles. The algorithm operates by attempting to move directly towards the goal along a straight line (the M-line). When an obstacle is encountered, the robot circumnavigates the obstacle's boundary until it can resume moving directly towards the goal.

**Key Concepts:**

- **M-line (Main Line):** The straight line connecting the start position to the goal position.
- **Boundary Following:** The process of circumnavigating an obstacle when the direct path is blocked.
- **Rejoining the M-line:** After circumnavigating an obstacle, the robot seeks to return to the M-line to continue towards the goal.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Move Towards Goal Along M-line:**
    - The robot attempts to move directly towards the goal along the M-line.
    
2. **Obstacle Detection:**
    - If an obstacle is detected within a threshold distance while moving towards the goal, the robot switches to boundary following mode.
    
3. **Boundary Following:**
    - The robot circumnavigates the obstacle's boundary, maintaining a consistent distance from the obstacle.
    
4. **Rejoining the M-line:**
    - While following the boundary, the robot continuously checks if it has rejoined the M-line.
    - If the robot successfully re-joins the M-line and the goal is still reachable along the M-line, it resumes moving directly towards the goal.
    
5. **Goal Reached:**
    - The robot continues this process until it reaches the goal position or determines that the goal is unreachable.

**Advantages:**

- **Simplicity:** Easy to implement without the need for complex computations or extensive environmental mapping.
- **Reliability:** Guarantees that the robot will eventually reach the goal if a path exists.

**Limitations:**

- **Efficiency:** May result in longer paths compared to more sophisticated algorithms like A* or D*.
- **Local Optima:** Can get stuck in environments with certain obstacle configurations.

        - The robot attempts to move directly towards the goal along the M-line.
        - Continuously checks for obstacles using front-left and front-right LiDAR data.
        - Calculates the angle towards the goal and adjusts its heading using a simple proportional controller.
        - Publishes velocity commands to move forward and adjust orientation.
        - If an obstacle is detected within the threshold distance, transitions to the `BOUNDARY_FOLLOWING` state.
        - Upon reaching the goal within the specified threshold distance, stops and reverts to the `IDLE` state.
    
    - **Boundary Following (`BOUNDARY_FOLLOWING` State):**
        - The robot circumnavigates the detected obstacle by moving forward at a predefined boundary following speed while turning at a set angular rate.
        - Continuously monitors whether it has rejoined the M-line by calculating its perpendicular distance to the line.
        - If the robot successfully re-joins the M-line, it transitions back to the `MOVING_TO_GOAL` state to resume direct navigation towards the goal.
        - If the robot fails to rejoin the M-line after a complete boundary traversal, it may log a warning or take alternative actions (not implemented in the current version).

4. **Automatic Mapping Behavior:**
    - In `AUTOMATIC_MAPPING` mode, the robot performs autonomous mapping by moving forward at a set linear speed.
